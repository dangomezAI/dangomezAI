### Hello ‚ú® I am Daniel Joseph Gomez, an innovative üë®‚Äçüî¨ Neurosurgical Scientist, Cell, Molecular, Structural and Computational Biologist üë®‚Äçüíª!

- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Daniel J. Gomez, a graduate student researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine and California State University, East Bay.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in biomedical translational research, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, exercise immunology, computational/systems cancer biology, spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, precision and evidence-based medicine.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning exercise immunology, computational cancer systems biology, and multimodal analysis as well as big data omics approaches.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm doing research, development, and analytics in basic science and translational biomedical research for multiple consortia MoTrPAC, HCA, HuBMAP, and HTAN.
- üì´ How to reach me sfdanielgomez@gmail.com
- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him/his
- ‚ö° Fun facts: I've authored several scientific peer-reviewed publications, and presented to global audiences.
- I won 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in grappling/jiu-jitsu competitions, and played other sports including basketball, soccer, football, and volleyball.
- I've also did lighting design for over 20 productions across U.S. cities, universities in multiple states in the USA.
- I've played multiple musical instruments: piano, clarinet, saxophone, guitar, 2nd violin, made 1st violin, and played orchestra internationally.
- I've also stayed consistent in doing state-of-the-art academic biomedical research  in six different medical schools and one veterinary medical college (Stanford Medicine, JABSOM, JHUSOM, UCSDSOM, UFCVM, DUCOM) and industry-level methods.
- I also love collaborating with other innovative academic institutions and companies! 


My <a href="https://djgomez.org">Academic profile</a> is here for your viewing pleasure üß≠ üåé.

- üó∫Ô∏è My present graduate studies is in Molecular and Cellular Atlases, Spatially Resolved Technologies. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing, Digital Pathology, Deep Omics Profiling in Health and Disease, AI/ML Data Science and Cloud Computing in Precision Medicine, Biomedicine, Genetics and Genomics, Multiomics, Translational Medicine, Immunology, Pathogenomics and Computational Biology. Currently, I am doing my thesis research on creating multi-modal maps of exerkines in spatially resolved multiomics with preclinical model data and the human biomolecular atlas project spatial data, exercise and physical activity multiomics, interorgan communication, signal transduction networks, and building multiscale single-cell spatial profiles of interorgan crosstalk at single-cell resolution, near-single cell super-resolution, and connecting cell-cell interactions with ligand-receptor interaction cascades and functions inside the cell that display the effect of exerkines measured in health, resilience, and disease.
